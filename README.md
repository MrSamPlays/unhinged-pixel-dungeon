# Unhinged Pixel Dungeon

Unhinged Pixel Dungeon is an open-source dungeon crawler based off of [Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://shatteredpixel.com/shatteredpd/) which is based on the [source code of Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/pixel-dungeon-gradle), by [Watabou](https://watabou.itch.io/).
This mod is currently WIP, and some features may not be fully implemented yet (or are features from upstream not fully implemented yet (like news, challenges, daily runs)).

## What's changed from Shattered?
- More and Larger rooms per floor (significantly larger rooms) An average floor is much larger than Shattered's Large Room floors.
- Trap reworks (more of them). Enemies can discover hidden traps as well as try to harness the use of traps against you (still a little jank, but working on that). Larger floors means more opportunities to use the dungeons traps against the enemies.
- Become the strongest you can ever be (more potions of strength, even more scrolls of upgrade)
- More item drops = strategic inventory management.
- It's a lot damper (waterskins can hold more dew which means you can heal more, but it's harder to bless ankhs as a result).
- Reworked YogDzewa (now with more hands)

## What am I thinking about working on next
- Curse that rearms/spawns new traps? (not sure how this should work)
- Tengu spawns traps that aren't poison dart traps?
- Some Boss reworks (particularly Goo & Yog)
- Trap focused hero (Engineer)
- Add more ranged enemies (that can use traps)

## How do I install this?
- Currently, Unhinged Pixel Dungeon only has support for Desktop (Tested on linux, though Windows should work as well, mac may need to be built from source). iOS support is not planned, but you can build it yourself if you follow the guides on the upstream repository.
- You will need java installed (java 11 or newer)
