# Unhinged Pixel Dungeon

Unhinged Pixel Dungeon is an open-source dungeon crawler based off of  [Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://shatteredpixel.com/shatteredpd/) which is based on the [source code of Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/pixel-dungeon-gradle), by [Watabou](https://watabou.itch.io/).

## What's changed from Shattered?
- More and Larger rooms per floor (significantly larger rooms) An average floor is much larger than Shattered's Large Room floors.
- Trap reworks (more of them). Enemies can discover hidden traps as well as try to harness the use of traps against you (still a little jank, but working on that). Larger floors means more opportunities to use the dungeons traps against the enemies.
- Become the strongest you can ever be (more potions of strength, even more scrolls of upgrade)
- More item drops = more inventory management.
- It's a lot damper (waterskins can hold more dew which means you can heal more, but it's harder to bless ankhs as a result).

## What am I thinking about working on next
- Curse that rearms/spawns new traps? (not sure how this should work)
- Tengu spawns traps that aren't poison dart traps?
- Some Boss reworks (particularly Goo & Yog)
- Trap focused hero (Engineer)
- Add more ranged enemies (that can use traps)
