## What's changed from Shattered?
- More and Larger rooms per floor (significantly larger rooms) An average floor is much larger than Shattered's Large Room floors.
- Trap reworks (more of them). Enemies can discover hidden traps as well as try to harness the use of traps against you. Larger floors means more opportunities to use the dungeons traps against the enemies.
- Become the strongest you can ever be (more potions of strength, even more scrolls of upgrade)
